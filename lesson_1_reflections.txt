1. Diff helped 
	to point out the error 
		very very fast

2. Can easily go back to the older version if the file 
	and easily change back to it

3. Changes should be committed only when a logical change is made.
	- ie fix of a bug
	- change in a feature
	- added documentation etc.
4. To track changes accross multiple file, Git provides a 'repository'
	which is a logical group of the files that are related and any changes can be viewed at once.

5. git log and git diff
	Git log helps to know the changes that are made in a repository
	Git view helps to get the difference part of a single commit. Note in this case a commit might be accross multiple files in a commit.

6. With Git checkout it is easy to go back to a previous version to 	 	checkout where a particular bug might have been introduced.
